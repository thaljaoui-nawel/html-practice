    <h1>Ragdoll</h1>
    <h2>About Regboll cats</h2>
    <p>
      The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue
      eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and
      silky soft coat.
    </p>
    <h2>Breed description.</h2>
    <h3>Temperament</h3>
    <p>
      The Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and calm nature, with
      claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian
      and Birman breeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic
      mutation or merely an instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens
      by their mother.The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the
      myth that Ragdolls are resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to
      breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility
      "might not be in the best interests of the cat".
